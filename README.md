# Python Learning Journey

This is where I plan to publicly demonstrate my learning journey in python. The goal of this is demonstrate my learning capabilities as a recent mechanical engineering graduate and not to demonstrate mastery at the level of a computer science major.

Welcome to my Python Learning Journey! This repository documents my progress as I learn Python from scratch. I created this repo to:
- Track my progress with an 8-week structured curriculum.
- Showcase my projects and exercises to potential employers.
- Practice clean coding, version control, and documentation.

## Repository Structure
- **week1_basics/**: Introductory concepts such as basic syntax, variables, and input/output.
- **week2_control_flow/**: Decision-making in code with `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
- **week3_loops/**: Iterations with `for` and `while` loops.
- **week4_data_structures1/**: Understanding lists, tuples, and strings.
- **week5_data_structures2/**: Working with dictionaries and sets.
- **week6_functions/**: Creating functions and modularizing code.
- **week7_files_error_handling/**: File I/O and error handling.
- **week8_projects_next_steps/**: Real-world mini-projects and directions for further learning.

## How to Use This Repository
- Explore each week’s folder to review the lessons, exercises, and projects.
- Code examples are in the `examples/` subfolders.
- Each week has a README with a summary and key takeaways.

## Goals
- Gain a solid foundation in Python programming.
- Build a portfolio of projects to showcase on GitHub.
- Prepare for advanced topics and eventual professional development.

*Cheers!*
