# Python Learning Journey

This is where I plan to publicly demonstrate my learning journey in python. The goal of this is demonstrate my learning capabilities as a recent mechanical engineering graduate and not to demonstrate mastery at the level of a computer science major.

Welcome to my Python Learning Journey! This repository documents my progress as I learn Python from scratch. I created this repo to:
- Track my progress with a structured curriculum.
- Showcase my projects and exercises to potential employers.
- Practice clean coding, version control, and documentation.

## Repository Structure
- **week1_basics/**: Introductory concepts such as basic syntax, variables, and input/output.
- **week2_control_flow/**: Decision-making in code with `if`, `elif`, and `else`.
- **week3_loops/**: Iterations with `for` and `while` loops.
- **Crash Course/**: Covers a a crash course on everything Python Fundamentals
## How to Use This Repository
- Explore each week’s folder to review the lessons, exercises, and projects.
- Code examples are in the `examples/` subfolders.

## Goals
- Gain a solid foundation in Python programming.
- Build a portfolio of projects to showcase on GitHub.
- Prepare for advanced topics and eventual professional development.

*Cheers!*
